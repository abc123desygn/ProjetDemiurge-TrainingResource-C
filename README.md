ProjectDemiurge Software involves training a **Convolutional Neural Network** (called **UNET**) to to learn a new concept (someone's face). In this NOTEBOOK, we'll work through setting up **Deep Neural Network**  This notebook training is not necessary to use the ProjectDemiurge Software and serves as a more advanced training for working with **MAGNETRON TECHNOLOGY**.
